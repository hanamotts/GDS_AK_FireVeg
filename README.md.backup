## Project overview

This project investigates predicting fire size in Alaska using machine learning with a particular interest in how well underlying forest vegetation and permafrost type are as predicting features.

### **Objectives**

1. Define fire size, vegetation and permafrost for Alaska
	1. Fire size: >10 acres
	1. Vegetation: forest species type
	2. Permafrost: continuous, discontinuous, free of permafrost, isolated masses, thick, moderately thick to thin, undefined
2. Create a basic machine learning model to predict wildfire based on vegetation and permafrost type

### **Datasets**

1. Fire
	1. Fire Incidents [National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::wildland-fire-incident-locations/explore?filters=eyJQT09TdGF0ZSI6WyJVUy1BSyJdfQ%3D%3D&location=65.115524%2C-150.698519%2C8.54)
2. Vegetation
	1. [USDA Forest Type](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/rastergateway/forest_type/alaska_forest_type_metadata.php)
3. Permafrost zones
	1. [Data Basin](https://databasin.org/datasets/ad1dff8c39634bedadb4fd40d36ead71/)

### **Python packages**

1. geopandas
2. pandas
3. jupyter
3. numpy
4. rasterio
5. matplotlib
7. seaborn
7. shapely
8. rioxarray
9. scikit-learn


### **Methods**

1. Import fire, forest type and permafrost shapefiles into Jupyter Notebook for analyzing
	1. The forest type raster will need to converted to a shapefile beforehand
2. Clean datasets
3. Determine how to correlate fire incidents to underlying vegetation and permafrost
4. Run series of random forest models to see how accurately each can predict fire size based on permafrost and vegetation
5. Analyze accuracy of models and determine how vegetation and permafrost work as predictors

### **Expected outcomes**

I expect there to be relatively high correlation values with fire size and certain vegetation types. The vegetation classes are closely tied to climatic zones and some vegetation is better fuel than others. Therefore, vegetation type could be a good predictor for fire size.

Permafrost may also be a good predictor of fire size because permafrost zones are controlled by climate and have close relations to vegetation type.

I think forest vegetation type and permafrost zone might be good features on their own.
